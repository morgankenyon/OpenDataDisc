## Future Sensors

* [High G Single Axis Accelerometer](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/retired/9332)
  * Discontinued, but I could potentially use 2 of these to build a high G sensor.
* [High Performace Gyroscope](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Analog-Devices/ADXRS649BBGZ?qs=WIvQP4zGanhEKWMUW9AK8A%3D%3D)
  * Maybe combine with above to create my own IMU, idk.
* [200 g sensors](https://www.mouser.com/c/sensors/motion-position-sensors/accelerometers/?acceleration=200%20g)
  * There does seem to be some 200 g sensors that are relatively affordable that I could buy and create my own breadboard for.
