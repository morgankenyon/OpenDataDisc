# WSN & Iot Tutorials

As I'm learning the nrf52840 Dev Kit board, I'm now going to start following this tutorial series: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTtLZIPcYfM&list=PLoKOKJqgqHs9mReagSVnB8FAQBJuRMCEt&index=1&t=14s

It goes through a lot of things about the board and will help me gain a basic understanding.

## Video #1 - Installing

* I downloaded the [nRF Connect for Desktop](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-tools/nRF-Connect-for-Desktop/Download?lang=en#infotabs) tool.
  * Currently on v5.0.2.
  * I proceeded to download the Bluetooth Low Energy testing application
  * I also installed the "Toolchain Manager".

## Video #2 - GPIOs, Leds and DeviceTree

Have some examples in `my_second_blinky`, mostly over my head thought.
