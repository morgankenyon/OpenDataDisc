# Random Notes

## Changes needed/Notes

* New Accelerometer
  * The Accelerometer listed above only supports up to 2,000 deg/s, which is ~333 RPM. Disc golf throws can go upwards of 1500 RPM. So that won't work long term.
  * I found [this gyroscope](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Analog-Devices/ADXRS649BBGZ?qs=WIvQP4zGanhEKWMUW9AK8A%3D%3D) that supports up to 20,000 deg/s, which is ~3,333 RPM, more than enough. It's just ~$120ish bucks.
* G forces found in disc golf throws.
  * [Here's a link](https://www.reddit.com/r/discgolf/comments/13fbddc/comment/jjxg0cy/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) stating a throw can generate up to 175 Gs.
