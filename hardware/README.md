# OpenDataDisc Hardware

Current status: Attempting to build a putter version. Something that can track low G and low rotation throws.

## Examples

The example folder currently contains work that in progress. As hardware designs finalize and are ready for other people to use/build themselves. They will get promoted from the examples folder to this folder.
