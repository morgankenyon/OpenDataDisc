# Putter Housing (3d Print)

After creating the PCB in example 1, I needed a housing to assemble everything together.

## Tinkercad Design

I have designed the following 3d printed housing:

It has 4 screw holes to attach the PCB, a well for the battery and 2 spacers to ensure nothing damages the circuit board.

The 3d design is contained in the [Putter Housing v2.zip](./Putter%20Housing%20v2.zip) file for anyone interested in making their own.
