# NRF52 Sense PCB Design

After watching [this youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vHB8AUQKWM), it made the point that if I am not planning on using Wifi, the esp32 is a bit overkill. I can reduce my power/battery requirements by picking another board.

So I landed on the NRF52 microcontroller. I specifically have bought a [Seeed Studio XIAO nRF52840 (Sense)](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/XIAO_BLE/).

This experiment is an attempt to design a PCB that I can attach the dev board to, to one day put it on a disc.
